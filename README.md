# Genetic Algorithms Practice

The goal for this repo is to learn the basics of genetic algorithms, and as a stretch goal to write a program that will run simulations while varying certain parameters (e.g. the length of string passed into the "To be or not to be" string-learner, the fitness function -- linear vs quadratic, say -- or the mutation rate) and spit out information about how complexity of input affects length of time needed to execute. This would be a nice concrete way to get into big O.

One idea is to build Pong and then teach the computer how to play it. A fun twist would be to give the player a control to alter the speed of the ball (after they have shot it), and see how the computer optimizes this.

All of this code draws heavily from CodingTrain's video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jv3CgDN9sc&t=420s.
