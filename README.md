# Genetic Algorithms Practice

The goal for this repo is to learn the basics of genetic algorithms, and as a stretch goal to write a program that will run simulations while varying certain parameters (e.g. the length of string passed into the "To be or not to be" string-learner, the fitness function -- linear vs quadratic, say -- or the mutation rate) and spit out information about how complexity of input affects length of time needed to execute. This would be a nice concrete way to get into big O.
